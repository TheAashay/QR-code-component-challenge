## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I knew what flexbox was in theory, here I learnt how and where can I apply it.
I also learnt about pseudo-class :hover and how to apply it properly.

### Continued development

This QR code project could be used as a reference to brush up concepts or as a template for my future projects.

### Useful resources

- [https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/learn-css-flexbox-by-building-a-photo-gallery/step-1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me understand the concept of flexbox.
